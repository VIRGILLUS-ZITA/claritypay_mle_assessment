# AI Usage Disclosure

AI tools (ChatGPT) were used during development as an assistant for:

  - code structuring guidance
  
  - debugging explanations
  
  - documentation wording suggestions
  
  - prompt engineering refinement

  - fine tuning ML model features

  - guidance for github structuring and generating readme files

The following were not generated blindly:

  - system design decisions

  - model logic

  - data processing logic

  - feature engineering choices

  - evaluation interpretation

All generated code was reviewed, modified, tested, and integrated manually.

The final implementation reflects deliberate engineering decisions and independent validation.
