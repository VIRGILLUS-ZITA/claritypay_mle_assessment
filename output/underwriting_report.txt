Elevated Risk Assessment for the Portfolio

The high risk exposure volume of 1552000 and a disproportionate number of high-risk merchants (48.0%) justify an elevated overall portfolio risk classification. The average risk score of 0.341 further supports this assessment.

Transaction volume is a significant risk driver, with the top five risky merchants (M002, M005, M011, M017, and M041) cumulatively accounting for 434000 in transactions, which is approximately 28% of the total portfolio volume. The high-risk nature of these merchants is also evident from their elevated risk scores, with three out of five exceeding a risk score of 0.95.

M002 and M011 are particularly concerning, with M002's high-risk score (0.99) and substantial transaction volume (89000). Similarly, M011's significant volume (98000) and high-risk score (0.93) warrant closer scrutiny.

Given the portfolio's elevated risk profile and the dominant influence of transaction volume, I recommend a "monitor" operational decision to ensure continuous monitoring of these high-risk merchants' dispute behavior and transactions. This approach will enable proactive intervention and minimize potential losses.
