Based on the provided portfolio data, I classify the overall portfolio risk as elevated.

The dominant risk drivers are dispute behavior and transaction volume, with high-risk merchants accounting for 44% of the total. M005 and M002, two high-risk merchants from the United States, account for a significant share of the high-risk exposure volume at 45000 and 89000 respectively, both with extremely high risk scores (0.99). This indicates a high likelihood of disputes.

The evidence suggests that these merchants are driving the elevated portfolio risk. Therefore, I recommend manual review is required to further assess the risk profiles of these merchants and mitigate potential dispute risks.

This decision follows from the data, as the high-risk exposure volume and high-risk scores of M005 and M002 indicate a higher likelihood of disputes, which requires closer scrutiny.
