Internal Risk Note:

Based on portfolio data, I classify the overall risk level as elevated. The high-risk merchant proportion (42%) and exposure volume ($1,413,000) exceed acceptable thresholds.

Dominant risk drivers are dispute behavior and transaction volume. Merchants M005 and M002, both from the United States, exhibit high risk scores (1.00 and 0.99, respectively), indicating a propensity for disputes. The high transaction volumes of these merchants ($45,000 and $89,000, respectively) further contribute to the elevated risk profile.

I recommend manual review required for these merchants to ensure adequate risk mitigation strategies are in place.

This decision follows from the evidence as it addresses the heightened dispute potential and large transaction volumes associated with these high-risk merchants.
