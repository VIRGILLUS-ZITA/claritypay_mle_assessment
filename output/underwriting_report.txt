Based on the provided portfolio data, I classify the overall portfolio risk as elevated. The high proportion of high-risk merchants (42%) and the significant exposure volume attributed to these entities (1405000) are primary drivers of this classification.

The dominant risk drivers are dispute behavior and transaction volume. Merchants M005 and M002, both located in the United States, exhibit a high-risk score of 0.99, indicating a higher likelihood of disputes. These merchants' significant transaction volumes further contribute to the elevated portfolio risk. Additionally, merchant M011 from Spain has an average risk score of 0.91, also suggesting a moderate to high level of dispute potential.

As a result, I recommend that these three merchants be placed under manual review and approval requirements, citing their high-risk profiles as justification for this decision.
