Based on the provided portfolio data, I classify the overall portfolio risk as elevated. The high-risk merchant composition of 40% and the significant volume exposure of $1,265,000 indicate a heightened level of risk.

The dominant risk drivers are dispute behavior and transaction volume. The expected disputes amount to $32,589.15, suggesting a moderate dispute rate. Furthermore, the top risky merchants (M005, M002, and M011) demonstrate high-risk profiles with elevated risk scores (0.99-0.93) and substantial volumes.

Merchant M005, for instance, carries an extremely high risk score of 0.99, with a transaction volume of $45,000. Similarly, merchant M002 boasts an equally high risk score and significant volume exposure of $89,000. These merchants contribute to the elevated overall portfolio risk.

In light of these findings, I recommend manual review required for new applications from high-risk merchants like M005 and M002. This decision follows directly from the data-driven evidence highlighting their extremely high risk profiles.
