Based on the provided portfolio data, I classify the overall risk of this merchant portfolio as elevated. The high proportion of high-risk merchants (40%) and the associated volume of 1265000 indicate a significant exposure to potential disputes.

Dominant risk drivers include dispute behavior, with an expected disputes total of 33187.7, and transaction volume, with several merchants displaying high volumes. Internal risk signals also suggest elevated risk, as seen in the average risk score of 0.327.

Supporting evidence can be found in the top risky merchants: M005 and M002, both located in the United States, demonstrate high-risk scores (1.00 and 0.98 respectively) and significant transaction volumes (45000 and 89000). These merchants contribute to the overall elevated risk profile of the portfolio.

Given this assessment, I recommend a manual review be required for new transactions from these high-risk merchants. This decision is justified by the elevated risk scores and dispute behavior exhibited by M005 and M002, indicating a need for closer scrutiny to mitigate potential losses.
